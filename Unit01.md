**Unit 1: Architecture in Republican Rome and the Early Empire** <span
id="1"></span> 
*This course begins with the earliest known architecture of the ancient
city of Rome, which dates back to the eighth century BC and the founding
of Rome by Romulus.  Rome’s relationship to its Greek neighbors and to
the Etruscans (whom they superseded in Italy) is of paramount importance
to our study of this period, as Roman architecture initially borrowed
from both of these cultures as it created an innovative architecture
full of new motifs and technologies.  In accordance with the Roman
Empire’s desire to conquer vast territories, its architecture also
suggests power and domination.  Meanwhile, technological innovations
freed the Romans from the kinds of restrictions that had previously
limited architecture.  Roman architecture could now take almost any
shape in even the most unfavorable of settings.   
  
 At the end of this unit, you will understand the developments of early
Roman architecture and recognize some of the most important monuments of
Ancient Rome.*
