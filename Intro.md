In this course, we will study the architecture of Ancient Rome,
beginning with its origins in the eighth century BC, and continuing
through the fourth century AD with the move of the Roman capital to
Constantinople.  The course of lectures and readings outlined below will
familiarize you with the major building methods and styles used in Roman
architecture.  In addition, interior decoration (including the very
important topic of Roman wall painting) will be addressed.  By the end
of the course, you will be able to identify some of the most important
works of Roman architecture and discuss the historical and cultural
conditions that informed their production. An important theme throughout
the first half of the course is the relationship between Ancient Rome
and Greek and Etruscan cultures, which were highly influential in the
formation of a distinctive Roman architecture.  Understanding the role
that Roman architecture played in the eastern and western Roman
provinces is also significant to this course, as it draws Roman
architecture into a broader geographical and cultural context.  Roman
art and culture were tremendously important for Western culture after
the fall of the Roman Empire; by completing this course, you will be
well-prepared for study of later Western architecture. Note: Throughout
this course, you may find it useful to refer to the
