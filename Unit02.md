**Unit 2: Architecture of Later Rome and the Provinces** <span
id="2"></span> 
The second half of this course looks at later Rome, beginning with the
Emperor Trajan and his many important monuments in Rome.  Building on
the information you learned in the first half of this course, you will
follow the development of Roman architectural styles and ambitions as
the Roman Empire gained power and expanded its borders.  As the Empire
grew, it began to build important structures in distant Roman provinces
and continued to build in Rome, but on a gargantuan scale.  This unit
ends with the reign of Emperor Constantinople, Rome’s first Christian
Emperor, a phase in Roman history that anticipates—in its history as
well as in its art—the Christian Middle Ages.
